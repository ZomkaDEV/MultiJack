# MultiJack

## Maintain multiple instances of Jackbox with ease!

### Why?  
Installing Jackbox mods required you to overwrite the files of your installs, which meant if you wanted to play a different mod or wanted to play the vanilla game, you had to reinstall the game or maintain multiple folders which you had to juggle around...  
Well that's no longer a need with MultiJack!  

MultiJack allows you to have multiple instances you can mod and easily launch through MultiJack's launcher, which automatically starts up when you launch any Jackbox game!

## Warning!  

MultiJack will mess with your `localconfig.vdf` file! Any corruption that could happen is on you.

Also keep in mind that MultiJack is still in alpha and hasn't been tested on as many games or hardware, if you ever run into any issues, open an issue on the repository or contact me on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JDnJuCBxyp).
